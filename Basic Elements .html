	<p><b><h1>INTRODUCTION</h1></b><br>
<i><q>Graphic desig</i> is the creative planning and execution of visual communication.</q> One learns to create a combination of shapes and forms, words and images, in order to reproduce them in some flat medium (two dimensional - paper, cardboard, cloth, plastic, video, computer, or projection screen, on poster, billboard, or other signage) or in a three-dimensional form (fabricated or manufactured) in order to convey information to a targeted audience. All graphic design has a purpose or function. Usually its purpose is commercial to explain aesthetically something -- to express, inform, and influence the thoughts and actions of its audience.<br>  
<blockquots>This subject introduces the student to art intended to communicate information and advertising. The focus is on studying and using layout and design concepts used in the graphic design field. The students will employ both analog media (drawing with pencil and paper, etc.) and digital media -- using up-to-date computer tools (graphics hardware and software - for drawing, painting, layout, typography, scanning, and photography).</blockquots></p>

	<h2>INFRASTRUCTURE/RESOURCES</h2><br> 
Each school that offers <strong>Graphic design</strong> subject should have well furnished studio-cum-laboratory where students can sit and work. Studios must be equipped with sufficient number of computers and accessories. A complete bibliography with respect to books, museums and institutions of Graphic designs should be available for use of students and teachers. The art-teachers need to be oriented to act as Graphic design instructor. Nevertheless, they must be trained periodically with respect to the latest development in the field of Graphic design. The Designers working in various organizations should be invited to interact with students. Students should be exposed to work situations and latest trends and developments in this area of <em>communication.</em><hr><br>
